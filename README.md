## Projects

### 1. Sales Performance Analysis

- **Project Objective**:
  - Create a detailed [Customer Performance Report](Sales_performance.pdf) that evaluates sales performance across different markets and customers.
  - Conduct a comparative analysis of [market performance vs. sales targets](Market_perfromance.pdf) to identify key opportunities and challenges.
  - Full [Financial Report](Financial_Report.pdf) that includes various aother key details.

- **Purpose**:
  - To enable businesses to monitor their sales efforts effectively and make data-driven decisions.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Data Cleaning and Automation**: Use Excelâ€™s Power Query to clean large datasets, remove duplicates, split columns, and structure data into a usable format.
  - **Data Visualization**: Using Excel charts and conditional formatting to visually represent KPIs.
  - **PivotTables**: Summarize sales data by region, customer, and time period for dynamic filtering.
  - **Sales Insights**: Identify potential areas for customer discounts and negotiation opportunities.

### 2. Financial Reporting

- **Project Objective**:
  - Create Profit & Loss (P&L) reports by [Fiscal Year](P&L_Years.pdf) and [Month](P&L_Months.pdf), with additional reports segmented by [Market](P&L_Markets.pdf), and [Gross Margin by Quarters](GM%_by_Quarters.pdf).

- **Purpose**:
  - To assess the financial health of a company, support internal decision-making, and present insights to stakeholders.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Power Query**: Automate data extraction, transformation, and loading processes to streamline the financial reporting workflow.
  - **Data Modeling**: Integrate data from multiple sources and create relationships between tables for more advanced reporting.
  - **PivotTables**: Easily switch between markets, fiscal years, and quarters to view key financial metrics.
  - **Report Design**: Design professional, easy-to-read P&L reports that highlight key financial metrics like Net Sales, Profit/Loss, Gross Margin, and Gross Margin %.
  - **Fiscal Year Calculations**: Include fiscal year conversions and breakdowns by business quarters for more accurate time-based analysis.
  - **Filters & Visualizations**: Implement advanced filters and slicers to easily view segmented financial data, while using Excel charts for revenue, expense, and profit visualizations.
  - **Scenario Analysis**: Compare different fiscal periods to spot trends and deviations from targets.

### 3. Scenario Planning Tool

- **Project Objective**:
  - Develop a Customer [Discount Approval tool](DiscountApproval.pdf) to help the Sales Team determine the optimal discount they can offer to customers while meeting financial targets.

- **Purpose**:
  - To assess financial risk, enhance internal decision-making, and present data-driven insights to stakeholders.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Data Visualization**: Create a dynamic dashboard summarizing key financial metrics such as Discounts, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), Average Net Invoice Sales, Gross Margin, and Financial Targets using Excel formulas.
  - **Formulas Used**:
  - SUMIFS() for calculating Net Sales.
  - Gross Margin = (Net Sales - COGS) / Net Sales.
  - Price Post Discount = Original Price - Discount Amount.
  - Net Sales = Price Post Discount * Quantity Sold.
  - Target = (Gross Margin / Target Gross Margin) * 100.
  
  - **Scenario Analysis**: Perform scenario-based comparisons (Best Case, Realistic Case, and Worst Case) to analyze various discounting strategies and their impact on financial goals. This allows the identification of trends, risks, and opportunities for more informed decision-making.

### 4. Feasibility Matrix

- **Project Objective**:
  - Utilize Excel to [prioritize projects](FeaseabilityMatrix.pdf) by assessing their feasibility, impact, and size requirements.

- **Purpose**:
  - Facilitate the selection process by providing a clear, data-driven method to evaluate and rank projects based on key criteria such as organizational impact, project size, required time, and overall feasibility.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Criteria Tables**: Develop tables to systematically evaluate projects against criteria such as feasibility, impact, and size.
  - **Bubble Chart**: Create a bubble chart to visually represent the feasibility matrix. Each bubble represents a project, with its position and size indicating feasibility, impact, and size.
  - **Visualisation**: Use the chart to quickly identify high-priority projects that offer high impact with manageable feasibility and size.
 
- **Explanation of Key Factors**:
  - **Feasibility**: Measures how practical and achievable a project is, considering resources, expertise, and potential risks.
  - **Impact**: Assesses the potential benefits or contributions of the project to the organization.
  - **Size**: Represents the scope and scale of the project, including resource requirements and complexity.
